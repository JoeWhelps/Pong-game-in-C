This is the text file briefly explaining how the program "Rainbow Pong" by Joe Whelpley runs.

In order to start the game, click on the center and then move the blocks one at a time so as to intercept the moving ball.
To move the left block up click the 'w' key and to move it down click the 's' key. To move the right block up click the 'i' key and to move it down click the 'j' keys on your keyboard.

As the ball hits off either the blocks or the ceiling/floor everything will change color and also the ball will slowly start getting faster and faster. Keep the ball in as long as you can and you will see your final speed at the end. Feel free to quit at any time by clicking 'q'
